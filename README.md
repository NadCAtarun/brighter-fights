This is a companion app for the fantastic MMORPG
[Brighter Shores](https://www.brightershores.com/)

Based on data from the equally fantastic
[Brighter Shores Wiki](https://brightershoreswiki.org/)

The tool will recommend enemies, weapons, and shields
(with links to the relevant pages on the wiki),
based on the following things:

- The target combat profession
    - Guard, Scout, Minefighter, or Watchperson
- The player's faction
    - Cryoknight, Guardian, or Hammermage
- The corresponding levels
- A level offset for players preferring to fight mobs above or below their level
- A strategy between:
    - Exploiting elemental vulnerabilities whenever possible
    - Picking the fastest weapon the enemy is not immune to
